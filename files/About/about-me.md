So a brief introduction to what you have just got yourself into. I am 20 years late to the scene but I always wanted to start a blog so that my random rants have a place to stay other than my fleeting memory. I know every opinion writer and his dog have a newsletter today, but I miss the days when blogs were ubiquitous and social media feeds were scarce.

I just hope that even if there are some regrets in your life today, like eating that one extra slice of pizza or not completing your steps walked goal, but signing up for this newsletter is not one of those
